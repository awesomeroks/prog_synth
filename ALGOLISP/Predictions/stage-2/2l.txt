given arrays of numbers a , b and c , find number of positions d such that d - th element among the values in a that are smaller than largest element of b , which is strictly less than maximum element of b is bigger than d - th element in c
you are given arrays of numbers a , b and c and a number d , compute values among values among elements of a that also appear in b also appearing in c times d
you are given numbers a , b , c and d , let how many times you can replace a with sum of its digits before it becomes a single digit number and b be the coordinates of one end and c and d be the coordinates of another end of segment e , find fibonacci number at position equal to the length of segment e rounded down
consider a number and an array of numbers b , let c be number of positions such that numbers from 0 to the given number ( exclusive ) has a bigger element on that position than b , reverse digits in c , your task is to compute c
given an array of numbers a and numbers c and b , compute the difference of elements among values of a multiplied by two and the product of c and b
you are given numbers a , b , c , d and e , let a and b be the coordinates of one end and c and the product of d and e with its digits reversed be the coordinates of another end of segment f , find the length of segment f squared
consider an array of numbers , your task is to find middle element among values in the given array doubled
