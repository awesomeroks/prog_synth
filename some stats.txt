S2: you are given an array of numbers a , let b be largest element among values in a squared , which is strictly less than maximum element among values in a squared , reverse digits in b , what is the b
GT: consider an array of numbers , multiply each value of the given array by itself , let b be largest element in the given array , which is strictly less than maximum element in the given array , reverse digits in b , your task is to find b

S1: [ reduce [ reverse [ digits [ reduce [ filter [ map a square ] [ partial0 [ reduce [ map a square ] 0 max ] > ] ] 0 max ] ] ] 0 [ lambda2 [ + [ * arg1 10 ] arg2 ] ] ]
Gt: [ reduce [ reverse [ digits [ reduce [ filter [ map a square ] [ partial0 [ reduce [ map a square ] 0 max ] > ] ] 0 max ] ] ] 0 [ lambda2 [ + [ * arg1 10 ] arg2 ] ] ]

S2 FAILED.

S2: you are given arrays of numbers a and e and numbers b and c , define d as elements in last half of e on positions from b till c ( 0 based ) , what is the number of values in a that are less than values on the same position in d
GT: consider an array of numbers , multiply each value of the given array by itself , let b be largest element in the given array , which is strictly less than maximum element in the given array , reverse digits in b , your task is to find b

S1: 
Gt: [ reduce [ map [ range 0 [ min [ len [ slice a b c ] ] [ len [ slice e [ / [ len e ] 2 ] [ len e ] ] ] ] ] [ lambda1 [ if [ < [ deref [ slice a b c ] arg1 ] [ deref [ slice e [ / [ len e ] 2 ] [ len e ] ] arg1 ] ] 1 0 ] ] ] 0 + ]

S2 FAILED.
